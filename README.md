# Laravel 11 Project

Welcome to the Laravel 11 project! This README will guide you through the setup process to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **PHP**: Version 8.2 or later
2. **Composer**: Dependency manager for PHP
3. **Node.js and npm**: For managing frontend dependencies (Optional if your project uses them)
4. **MySQL**: Or any other database you plan to use

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install PHP Dependencies

Run the following command to install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies (Optional)

If your project uses Node.js for assets:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your database and other configuration details:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

### 5. Generate Application Key

Generate a new application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 6. Run Database Migrations

Run the migrations to set up your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

(Optional) Seed the database if your project includes seeders:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### 7. Compile Frontend Assets (Optional)

If your project uses Laravel Mix or Vite for asset compilation:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 8. Start the Development Server

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application will be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Testing

To run tests (if available):

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and versions match the prerequisites.
2. Check your `.env` configuration for any missing or incorrect details.
3. Review the Laravel documentation for additional guidance: [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x).

## Notes

- Ensure that your `.env` file is properly configured before running migrations or seeders.
- If you encounter issues, check the Laravel and Inertia documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
- You can find the credentials in `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php`.
